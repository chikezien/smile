#  Instructions for deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster

### STEP 1 - Prepare Kubernetes Manifests:
Save the Kubernetes manifests (Deployment.yaml, Service.yaml, HorizontalPodAutoscaler.yaml, and Ingress.yaml) to a directory on your local machine.

### STEP 2 - Connect to your Kubernetes Cluster:
Use the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl) to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. If you're using a managed Kubernetes service like Amazon EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS, you'll typically need to configure kubectl to connect to your cluster by following the provider-specific instructions.

### STEP 3 - Apply the Manifests:
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Kubernetes manifests and apply them to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command:

`kubectl apply -f Deployment.yaml`
`kubectl apply -f Service.yaml`
`kubectl apply -f HorizontalPodAutoscaler.yaml`
`kubectl apply -f Ingress.yaml`

This command will create the necessary Kubernetes resources (Deployment, Service, HorizontalPodAutoscaler, and Ingress) on your Kubernetes cluster.

### STEP 4 - Verify Deployment:
After applying the manifests, use kubectl commands to verify that the resources have been created successfully:

`kubectl get deployments`
`kubectl get pods`
`kubectl get services`
`kubectl get hpa`
`kubectl get ingress`

Ensure that the desired number of pods are running, the service is accessible, the HorizontalPodAutoscaler is configured correctly, and the Ingress resource has been created with the expected configuration.

### STEP 5 - Access Your Application:
If you've configured an Ingress resource to expose your application externally, use the specified domain name (e.g., my-app.example.com) to access your application in a web browser. If you're using a LoadBalancer service type, wait for the external IP address to be provisioned, and then use that IP address to access your application.
